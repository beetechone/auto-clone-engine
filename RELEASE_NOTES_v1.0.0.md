## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Limitations (P3 - Optional Enhancements)

1. **PDF/EPS Export**: Not implemented (PNG/SVG available)
   - Impact: Low - Most users prefer PNG/SVG
   - Workaround: Convert SVG to PDF using external tools

2. **Real-time Analytics**: 5-minute cache refresh (no WebSocket)
   - Impact: Low - 5-minute delay acceptable for analytics
   - Workaround: Manual refresh if needed

3. **Geo-location**: Not implemented (privacy-first approach)
   - Impact: Low - IP tracking available (anonymized)
   - Workaround: Use IP to geo service externally

4. **Free Trial**: Not configured
   - Impact: Low - Free tier available
   - Workaround: Users can use Free plan

5. **Two-Factor Auth**: Optional (not enforced)
   - Impact: Low - Available via Auth0 for admin
   - Workaround: Enable MFA in Auth0 if needed

### No Critical or High-Priority Issues ✅

All critical and high-priority features are implemented and tested.
