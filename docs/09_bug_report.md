# CI Bug Report (auto)
Run: 18818826816
Date: Sun Oct 26 13:45:47 UTC 2025

## Failures
- None - All unit tests passing (38 tests)

## Coverage Report
- Total Coverage: 56.32%
- Target: 75%
- Status: Below target

### Coverage by Module:
- logging_config.py: 100.00%
- models.py: 100.00%
- billing.py: 90.00%
- main.py: 72.41%
- database.py: 54.55%
- auth.py: 45.45%
- library.py: 38.04%

### Notes:
- Library module has lower coverage because full integration tests with database are not implemented
- All critical authentication and authorization paths are tested
- All route registrations are verified
- Consider adding integration tests with test database in future phases

## Phase 3 Implementation Status:
- ✅ Backend Library endpoints implemented (CRUD, soft-delete, pagination, sorting)
- ✅ Frontend Dashboard with API integration
- ✅ Editor Save/Update to Library functionality
- ✅ QR Item detail page
- ✅ E2E tests created (library.spec.ts)
- ✅ All 38 unit tests passing
- ⚠️ Coverage below 75% target (integration tests needed for higher coverage)

## Recommendations:
1. Add integration tests with test database for library endpoints
2. Add more unit tests for database operations with mocking
3. Consider creating fixtures for common test scenarios
