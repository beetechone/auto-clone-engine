### 🔍 Observations & Insights

1. **Target Site Analysis**:
   - Target is production-ready with full feature set
   - Local is MVP-focused with planned phases
   - Approach: iterative development vs. full launch

2. **Technical Decisions**:
   - Chose Auth0 for auth (vs. custom implementation)
   - Chose Stripe for billing (industry standard)
   - Chose FastAPI for performance and async support
   - Chose Next.js for modern React with SSR

3. **Development Velocity**:
   - Phase 1 completed in 1 session
   - Clear phase boundaries enable parallel work
   - Test-first approach catches issues early

### 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Spec-First Approach**: Creating SRS before coding saved time
2. **Test Coverage**: Early testing revealed edge cases in billing
3. **Structured Logging**: JSON logs enable better debugging
4. **Containerization**: Docker ensures consistent environments
5. **Minimal Changes**: Small, focused PRs are easier to review

### 📋 Action Items

**Immediate (Phase 1)**:
- [x] Complete unit tests (21 tests)
- [x] Update documentation
- [x] Create self-comparison report
- [ ] Run e2e tests with docker-compose
- [ ] Lighthouse audit (requires Phase 2 UI)

**Next Phase (Phase 2)**:
- [ ] Research QR encoding libraries (segno, qrcode)
- [ ] Design editor UI wireframes
- [ ] Implement QR generation endpoint
- [ ] Build export functionality
- [ ] Add negative tests for invalid inputs

**Future Phases**:
- Phase 3: Dashboard and library
- Phase 4: Templates and admin
- Phase 5: Billing enforcement
- Phase 6: Analytics and hardening

---

**Conclusion**: Phase 1 MVP successfully replicates core backend infrastructure with authentication and billing. The foundation is solid for Phase 2 feature development. All acceptance criteria met or ready for validation with running services.
